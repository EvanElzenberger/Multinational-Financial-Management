### Question 1
Mr. James Silber just sold a share of Nestle, a Swiss firm, for SF 5,080. The share was bought for SF 4,600 a year ago. The exchange rate is SF 1.60 per U.S. Dollar now and was SF 1.78 per dollar a year ago. Compute the rate of return on this investment in terms of U.S. dollars.

P1: 5080 SF

P0: 4600 SF

S0: 1.60 SF/USD

S1: 1.78 SF/USD

Rate of return in USD = (P1USD - P0USD) / P0USD

P1USD = 5080 / 1.60 = 3175 USD

P0USD = 4600 / 1.78 = 2584.27 USD

Rate of return = 3175 / 2584.27 = 22.86%

### Question 2 
Japan Life Insurance Company invested $7,000,000 in pure-discount U.S. bonds in may 2020 when the exchange rate was 111 Yen per dollar. The company liquidated the investment one year later for $7,500,000. The exvhange rate turned out to be 108 Yen per dollar at the time of liquidation. What rate of return did Japan Life realize ont his investment in Yen terms.

P1: 7,000,000 USD

P0: 7,500,000 USD

S0: 111 Yen/USD

S1: 108 Yen/USD

Rate of return in USD = (P1USD - P0USD) / P0USD

Rate of return = (7,000,000 - 7,500,000) / 7,500,000 = 7.14%

Rate of change in exchange rate = (S1(Yen/USD) - S0(Yen/USD)) / S0(Yen/USD)

Rate of change in exchange rate = (108 - 111) / 111 = -2.70%

Return on Yen = Return USD + Return exchange rate
Return in Yen = 7.14% + -2.70% = 4.44%

### Question 3
On the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, SAP SE stock closed at 105 Euro per share on Tuesday, March 16, 2021. SAP trades as an ADR on the NYSE. One underlying SAP share equals one ADR. On March 16, 2021, the USD / Euro spot exchange rate was 1.192 / 1.

A) At this exchange rate, what is the no-arbitrage U.S. dollar price of one ADR?

B) If SAP ADRs were trading at 127 USD when the underlying shares were trading in Frankfurt at 105 Euro, what could you do to earn a trading profit? Calculate the expected profit. Assume that transaction costs are negligibile.

A) No-arbitrage U.S. dollar price of one SAP ADR
SAP stock price in Euro = 105
Exhange rate 1.192 USD / Euro
No-arbitrage price in USD = 105 Euro x 1.192 USD /Euro = 125.076 USD of ADR

B) Arbitrage oppertunity and profit
Since ADR is trading at 127 USD but the no-arbitrage price is 125.076 USD, it means the ADR is overvalued 127 < 125.076. Expect ADR to decrease in value to 125.076

Short ADR

Buy back as  ADR approaches 125.076

Profit per share, 127 - 125.076 = 1.924 USD per ADR

### Question 4
At the start of 2020, the annual interest rate was 4.20% in the United States and 2.10% in Japan. The exchange rate was 115 Yen per dollar at the time. Mr. Jonas, who is the manager of a hedge fund, thought that the substantial interest advantage associated with investing in the United States relative to investing in Japan was not likely to be offset by the decline of the dollar against the Yen. He thus concluded that it might be a good idea to borrow in Japan and invest in the United States. At the start of 2020, in fact he borrowed 200 million Yen for one year and invested in the United States. At the end of 2020, the exchange rate was 119 Yen per dollar. How much did Mr. Jonas make in dollar terms?

Interest USD = 4.20% per year

Interest Yen = 2.10% per year

Inital Exchange Rate = 115 Yen / USD

Final Exchange Rate = 119 Yen / USD

Loan Ammount = 200,000,000 Yen

Convert borrowed Yen into USD at start of year times interest rate

(Loan Yen / S0(Yen/USD) * (1+iUSD)

USD received = 200,000,000 Yen / 115 Yen/USD = 1,739,130.43 USD * (1 + 4.20%) = 1,812,173.91

Calculate the cost of USD 

(Yen Loan + intrest) / final exchange rate

Cost USD = 200,000,000 * (1 + 2.10%) / 119 Yen/USD = 1.715.966.39

Profit USD = (Revenu USD - Cost USD)

Profit USD = 1,812,173.91 - 1.715.966.39 = 96,207.53

### Question 5
Princess Cruise Company (PCC) purchased a ship from Mitsubishi Heavy Industry. PCC owes Mitsubishi Heavy Industry 320 million Yen in one year. The current spot rate is 110 Yen per dollar and the one-year forward rate is 117 Yen per dollar. The annual interest rate is 2% in Japan and 5% in the U.S. PCC can also buy a one-year call option on Yen at the strike price of $0.0087 per yen for a premium of 0.012 cents per Yen.

A) Compute the future dollar costs of meeting this obligation using the forward hedge.

B) Assuming that the forward exchange rate is the best predictor of the future spot rate, compute the expected future dollar cost of meeting this obligation when the option hedge is used. 

C) At what future spot exchange rate will PCC be indifferent between the forward and option hedges? 

Payable 320,000,000 Yen

Initial Exchange Rate S0 = 110 Yen / USD

Forward Rate F1 = 117 Yen / USD

Yen Interst Rate = 2%

USD Interest Rate = 5%

Call Option on Yen

Strike price: $0.0087 per Yen

Premium: $0.00012 per Yen (0.012 cents)

A) Forward Hedge

Forward rate = 117 Yen / USD

Future Dollar Cost = 320,000,000 / 117 = 2,735,042.735

B) Option Hedge (Expected Spot = Forward Hedge)

Expected Spot USD / Yen = 1 / 117 = 0.008457009

Determine if option will be exercised

Option strike = 0.0087 USD / Yen

Expected Spot = 0.008457009 USD / Yen

Since Spot < Strike, the option will NOT be exercised. PCC will buy Yen at the SPOT rate.

Expected dollar cost (without option) = 320,000,000 * 0.008547009 = 2,735,042.735 USD

Option Premium = 0.00012 USD / Yen

Premium Cost = 320,000,000 * 0.0012 = 38,400 USD

Future Value of Premium = 38,400 * (1 + 0.05) = 40,320

Total Expected dollar cost with option

Cost of buying Yen at spot = 320,000,000 * 0.008547009 = 2,735,042.735

Total Cost with FV of Premium = 2,735,042.735 + 40,320 = 2,775,362.735

C) Find Indifferent Spot Rate

320,000,000 * (X) + 40,320 = 2,735,042.735 

x = 2,694,722.735 / 320,000,000 = 0.0084203848 USD / Yen

Convert Yen / USD

1 / 0.0084203848 = 118.7495 Yen / USD
